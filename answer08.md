The difference between a private and a protected modifier is:

Protected: The variable or function can be accessed from when it is defined and from any class that inherits from it.

Private: The variable or function can only be accessed from the class that is defined.

An example for private properties can be when we talk about a User type class, a user has a password, for this we use protected, since we can create another class to encrypt the passwords.

For the "private" modifier an example can be for the Encrypt class, we can have a class to decrypt a password, for this we use "private" so that only that class can carry out this process.

Regarding the difference between an Inheritance and Trait:

Inheritance: Inheritance is when a second class is used in another in order to use the properties and methods of the second class.

A trait: I have not used them, but what I do know is that it cannot be instantiated, what a class can do.
